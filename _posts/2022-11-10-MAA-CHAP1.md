# Chapter 1 Linear Equations

## 1.1 Introduction

A fundamental problem that surfaces in all mathematical sciences is that of analyzing and solving $m$ algebraic equations in $n$ unknowns.

## 1.2 Gaussian elimination and matrices

The problem is to calculate, if possible, a common solution for a system of $m$ linear algebraic equations in $n$ unknowns

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
a_{11}x_1 \; + \; a_{12}x_2 \; + \; \dots \; + \; a_{1n}x_n \; &= \; b_1, \\
a_{21}x_1 \; + \; a_{22}x_2 \; + \; \dots \; + \; a_{2n}x_n \; &= \; b_2, \\
\vdots \\
a_{m1}x_1 \; + \; a_{m2}x_2 \; + \; \dots \; + \; a_{mn}x_n \; &= \; b_m,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $a_{ij}$'s are the ***coefficients*** of the system.

For any such system, there are exactly three possibilities for the set of solutions.

### Three Possiblities
* Unique solution
* No solution
* Infinitely many solution

Dealing with a linear system is 

1. to decide which one of these three possibilities is true. 
2. to compute the solution if it is unique or to describe the set of all solutions if there are many solutions. 

Gaussian elimination is a tool that can be used to accomplish all of these goals.
