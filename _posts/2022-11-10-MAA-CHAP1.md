# Chapter 1 Linear Equations

## 1.1 Introduction

A fundamental problem that surfaces in all mathematical sciences is that of analyzing and solving $m$ algebraic equations in $n$ unknowns.

## 1.2 Gaussian elimination and matrices

The problem is to calculate, if possible, a common solution for a system of $m$ linear algebraic equations in $n$ unknowns

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
a_{11}x_1 \; + \; a_{12}x_2 \; + \; \dots \; + \; a_{1n}x_n \; &= \; b_1, \\
a_{21}x_1 \; + \; a_{22}x_2 \; + \; \dots \; + \; a_{2n}x_n \; &= \; b_2, \\
\vdots \\
a_{m1}x_1 \; + \; a_{m2}x_2 \; + \; \dots \; + \; a_{mn}x_n \; &= \; b_m,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $a_{ij}$'s are the ***coefficients*** of the system.

For any such system, there are exactly three possibilities for the set of solutions.

### Three Possiblities
* Unique solution
* No solution
* Infinitely many solution

Dealing with a linear system is 

1. to decide which one of these three possibilities is true. 
2. to compute the solution if it is unique or to describe the set of all solutions if there are many solutions. 

Gaussian elimination is a tool that can be used to accomplish all of these goals.

The elimination process relies on three simple operations by which to transform one system to another equivalent system.

1. Interchange the $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ equations.
2. Replace thr $i^{th}$ equation by a nonzero multiple of itself.
3. Replace the $j^{th}$ equation by a combination of itself plus a multiple of the $i^{th}$ equation.

At each step, the strategy is to focus on one position, called the *pivot position*, and to eliminate all terms below this position using the three elementary operations. The coefficient in the pivot position is called a *pivotal element*, while the equation in which the pivot lies is referred to as the *pivotal equation*. 

Only nonzero numbers are allowed to be pivots. If a coefficient in a pivot position is ever 0, then the pivotal equation is interchanged with an equation below the pivotal equation to produce a nonzero pivot. Unless it is 0,the first coefficient of the first equation is taken as the first pivot.

In general, at each step you move down and to the right to select the next pivot, then eliminate all terms below the pivot until you can no longer proceed. At this point, we say that the system has been *triangularized*. A triangular system is easily solved by a simple method known as *back substitution*.

### Algorithm for Back Substitution

If an $n \times n$ system has been triangularized to the form

coefficient matrix: $\mathbf{A}$
augmented matrix: $\left[ \mathbf{A} \vert b \right]$

$\mathbf{A}_{i*}$ denotes the $i^{th}$ row, $\mathbf{A}_{*j}$ denotes the $j^{th}$ column of matrix $\mathbf{A}$.

$\mathbf{A}_{m \times n}$ emphasize that matrix $A$ has shape $m \times n$.

Whenever $m = n$, $\mathbf{A}$ is called a *square matrix*. Otherwise, $\mathbf{A}$ is said to be *rectangular*
